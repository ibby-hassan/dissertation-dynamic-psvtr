UofG Individual Project (H) Dissertation: "Automatically generating 3D rotation test; can difficulty be matched?

The aim of this project is to innovate upon the existing UofG Purdue Spatial Visualisation Test: Visualisation of Rotations (PSVT:R) test by algorithmically generating shapes. A successful project will attempt to dynamically generate shapes and associated transformations in the test, and will conduct an evaluation to compare how similar difficulty scales between the original and the new.
